      <h2>What majors could you do with INFO</h2>
      <p>
        When completing a Bachelor of Commerce degree students can choose more
        than one major and minor. Popular majors and minors alongside INFO are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Management</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Studying management alongside Information Systems gives students a
              broad knowledge of the skills required by managers in both the
              commercial and public sector, through industry relevant case
              studies and projects. Doing management and Information Systems
              will allow you to develop the strengths required for IT management
              roles in the future.
            </li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Human Resources</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>

              students to gain insight into how companies use branding, slogans
              and advertising to sell products. Doing this alongside information
              systems will give you a great understanding of what sort of
              technology companies use and what they could use in the future.
              Jobs you could go into include marketing analytics, product
              marketing, IT communication and software administration.
            </li>

              allow students to apply their learning in both fields,
              particularly looking forward to the future of work as IT has an
              ever increasing influence on Human Resource management in terms of
              planning and management, recruitment, training and development and
              maintenance functions.
